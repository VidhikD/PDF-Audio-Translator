**Built a PDF-to-Speech Translator web application using Flask, PyPDF2, and gTTS, allowing users to upload PDF files, detect the language, translate the content into their chosen language, and convert it into speech. The app offers dynamic voice selection (male/female), language detection, and the ability to play or download the generated audio. With a clean and responsive UI, the project demonstrates text extraction, translation, and speech synthesis capabilities.**
